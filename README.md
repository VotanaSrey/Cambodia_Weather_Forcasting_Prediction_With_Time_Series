# Cambodia_Weather_Forcasting_Prediction_With_Time_Series
Weather Forecasting has gained researchers from worldwide societies over decades due to its substantial impact on global human life from agriculture, air traffic control to public health and safety. Anyway agriculture is the backbone of the economy.In a country like Cambodia, which has ever increasing demand for food due to rising population, advances in agriculture sectors are required to meet the needs and weather forecasting is in high demand for several applications in agriculture, air traffic services, foods ,energy and environment control. Weather forecasting is an expectation of what the weather will resemble in the next 1h, tomorrow , or 1 week from now. It will enable the farmers to maximise their crops yield and minimise the input cost as well as the losses due to reasons like uncertain rainfall, droughts etc.
